This folder contains Data Manipulation Language (DML) scripts for querying data related to cricket statistics. The DML scripts focus on three entities: Top 50 Batsmen, Top 50 Bowlers, and Top 50 All-rounders.

## Files:

### 1. [top_50_batsmen.sql](./top_50_batsmen.sql)

The top_50_batsmen.sql script provides queries for extracting and manipulating data to obtain the top 50 batsmen. It includes operations for selecting, filtering, and ordering batsmen based on statistical parameters.

### 2. [top_50_bowlers.sql](./top_50_bowlers.sql)

The top_50_bowlers.sql script provides queries for extracting and manipulating data to obtain the top 50 bowlers. It includes operations for selecting, filtering, and ordering bowler based on statistical parameters.

### 3. [top_50_all_rounders.sql](./top_50_all_rounders.sql)

The top_50_all_rounders.sql script provides queries for extracting and manipulating data to obtain the top 50 all rounders. It includes operations for selecting, filtering, and ordering all rounders based on statistical parameters.

## How to Use:

1. Execute these DML scripts in your database management system to perform queries and manipulations on the existing data.

2. Ensure that the database connection parameters within the scripts match your environment.

3. Leverage these scripts to gain insights into the top 50 batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders based on their statistical performances.

Note: These DML scripts assume the existence of the required tables or views, so make sure your database environment is set up accordingly.
