# <h4 align="left"> Table Schema: Stats - Cric Stat Analyzer üèè </h4>

<hr>

This document outlines the schema for the 'stats' table within the project. The 'stats' table is used to store cricket match statistics for three different formats: ODI, Test, and T20. Despite the variations in cricket formats, all three tables share a consistent schema, which is elucidated below.

## Overview

The 'stats' table captures comprehensive details about cricket matches, including player statistics, match events, and relevant contextual information. The schema provides a structured representation of the stored data.
